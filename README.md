# IVOA Interoperable Authentication Protocol

This document describes how services in the
[Virtual Observatory](https://ivoa.net)
can advertise their support for authentication methods,
especially for use by non-browser clients.

Stable versions of this document may become available through the
[IVOA document repository](http://ivoa.net/documents/).

To build a PDF or HTML version of this document, you will need a reasonably
complete LaTeX installation, a sufficiently capable `make`, preferably
[latexmk](https://personal.psu.edu/~jcc8/software/latexmk/) and probably
[rsvg-convert](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/LibRsvg). Alternatively, IVOA
provides a Docker Image with the required enviroment already installed
([ivoatex-docker](https://github.com/ivoa/ivoatex-docker)). For further
details, see [ivoatexDoc](https://ivoa.net/documents/Notes/IVOATexDoc/).
